# ML Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models for fraud detection.

## Files Generated After Training

- `isolation_forest.pkl` - Anomaly detection model
- `random_forest.pkl` - Fraud classification model
- `logistic_regression.pkl` - Binary classifier
- `dbscan.pkl` - Clustering model
- `scaler.pkl` - Feature scaling parameters
- `metadata.json` - Training metadata and timestamps

## Model Persistence

Models are automatically:
- Saved after training
- Loaded on service startup
- Updated every 24 hours (configurable)

## Security Note

These `.pkl` files contain only model parameters, not invoice data.
Safe to backup and restore between environments.
