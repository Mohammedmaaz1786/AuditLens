# AI-Powered OCR Extraction Setup

## 🚀 What Changed?

Instead of using complex regex patterns, we now use **Google Gemini AI** to intelligently extract structured data from invoice text!

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Smarter extraction** - AI understands context and invoice formats
- ✅ **Better accuracy** - Handles OCR errors and variations  
- ✅ **More fields** - Extracts everything: line items, addresses, payment info, notes
- ✅ **Flexible** - Works with any invoice format automatically

## 📦 Installation

1. **Install the new dependency:**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install google-generativeai==0.8.3
   ```

2. **Get your Google AI API Key:**
   - Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the key

3. **Add the API key to `backend/.env`:**
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Restart the backend:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **OCR** extracts raw text from the invoice image
2. **AI (Gemini)** analyzes the text and structures it into JSON
3. **Backend** validates and returns the data
4. **Frontend** displays it beautifully

## 📊 Extracted Fields

The AI now extracts:

### Basic Info
- Invoice Number
- Vendor Name
- Vendor Address
- Vendor Email
- Vendor Phone
- Bill To Name
- Bill To Address

### Dates & Amounts
- Invoice Date
- Due Date
- Subtotal
- Tax
- Total
- Amount Paid
- Balance Due
- Currency

### Line Items
- Description
- Quantity
- Rate
- Amount

### Additional
- Payment Instructions
- Notes
- Confidence scores for each field

## 🧪 Testing

Upload your invoice again and you should see:
- **All 3 line items** extracted correctly
- **Proper invoice number** (INV-005)
- **Vendor details** (Ad4tech Material LLC, address, email, phone)
- **Dates** in proper format (2021-06-22)
- **All amounts** (subtotal, total, balance due)
- **Higher confidence** scores

## 💡 Fallback

If Google API key is not configured, the system will:
- Log a warning
- Fall back to regex-based extraction
- Still work (but with lower accuracy)

## 📝 Notes

- The AI model used is `gemini-1.5-flash` (fast and cost-effective)
- API calls are free for reasonable usage (rate limited)
- The AI is smart enough to fix OCR errors (e.g., "O" vs "0")
- Confidence scores help identify uncertain extractions

## 🔒 Security

- API key is stored in `.env` (never committed to git)
- `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- No sensitive invoice data is stored
- API calls are made securely over HTTPS
